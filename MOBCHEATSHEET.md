## Mob Cheatsheet!
As quickly noted in the README.md, the mobs have slight preferences in regard to their weapon choices. With this bit of information, we can trick the system and own the mobs.

### Humanoids
Humanoids are the only mobs that have weapon preferences. You can identify humanoids by their names and taunts. A humanoid always speaks some kind of sophisticated language, whereas non-humanoids make sounds.
You can loosely identify the weapon preference based on the mobs kind of personality and identity.

Brutes (Bandits, Thugs etc.) typically prefer rock-type weapons.

Intellectual Individuals (Magicians, mostly) typically prefer scissors-type weapons.

Lords and Knights typically prefer paper-type weapons.

Please note that the above information is applied loosely, as some of the mobs deviate from their "predetermined preference", and some of them have no preference at all. But, something that you can be sure about is that if a mob has an upgraded weapon and a preference, then the preference will always be the upgraded weapon. Makes sense, eh?

### Non-humanoids
As mentioned above, non-humanoids never have weapon preferences. You can identify non-humanoids by their use of sounds instead of words, in their taunts.

And have fun!
